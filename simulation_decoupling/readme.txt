attached are off-resonance decoupling simulations for k=160 and k=670 which roughly
corresponds to the 15 kHz MAS measurements in Fig.4. They look not perfect but
quite similar. They are processed with 100 Hz line broadening for the k=670 and
140 Hz for the k=160 case. 


I included 28 kHz CSA \delta in the simulations which is a bit too large
since it is 40ppm @ 700 MHz but 18F is slightly lower. The bigger problem
are the rate constants. I think the ones at slow spinning are too high
because the T2 and the exchange are correlated and the line shape allows
many combinations. So I am rerunning the simulation with the same CSA but
using two times the rate constants at 30 kHz MAS. I can also change the
CSA if we want to do more fine tuning.

I rerun them with the proper CSA of 26352 for 700 MHz Fluorine resonance frequency
otherwise it looks a bit strange. This will be done before I go on vacation.

    - add_minima_to_chisquare: takes the chi square 2D figures and plots on top
      the minima of k_ex and T_2 from the chisquare fit. Minima are from the chisquare fit
      the fit in 1D for the apodization and the fit in 1D for the non apodization

    - test_offset_chisquare_fit_exp_sim_1D: Compare experiments and simulations 
      after adding the offset to the simulated data

    - chisquare_exp_sim_kex: Actual Chisquare fit to extract K_ex and T_2
      search around the minima of the 1D fits

    - figure_3_CF3_vs_kex: Making Figure 3 of the paper with Bloch-McConnel
      simulations of the self-decoupling of the CF3 quartet as a function of MAS

    - figure_3_CF3_vs_kex_fast_ex: Making Figure 3 of the paper with Bloch-McConnel
      simulations of the self-decoupling of the CF3 quartet as a function of MAS and 
      extrapolating the k_ex in the limit of fast exchange

    - fit_exp_sim_kex: Least square fit to extract K_ex and T_2 using cos^2 apod

    - fit_exp_sim_kex_no_apod: Least square fit to extract K_ex and T_2

    - fit_fun: fit function for the Bloch-McConnel

    - kex_vs_mas_plot: plot the resulting extracted fitted k_ex from the fits against
      MAS frequency

    - proc_fid: function from Kathrin to phase the spectra

    - test_CF3_self_decoupling_exp_vs_sim: tests from transferring the Bloch-McConnel
      script from Matematica to Matlab code
